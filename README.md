## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> Create a guitar tuning app that I can both hear the different notes to tune to or have the app hear my guitar and provide the necessary feedback to tune it.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- A Cosmic account and bucket
- Microphone access for pitch detection mode

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Cosmic credentials:
```env
COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your-bucket-slug
COSMIC_READ_KEY=your-read-key
COSMIC_WRITE_KEY=your-write-key
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
bun dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üìö Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Tuning Configurations

```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

// Get all available tunings
export async function getTunings() {
  try {
    const response = await cosmic.objects
      .find({ type: 'tunings' })
      .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
      .depth(1)
    
    return response.objects
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      return []
    }
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch tunings')
  }
}

// Get a specific tuning by slug
export async function getTuning(slug: string) {
  try {
    const response = await cosmic.objects
      .findOne({ type: 'tunings', slug })
      .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
      .depth(1)
    
    return response.object
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 404) {
      return null
    }
    throw error
  }
}
```

- **name** (text): Display name (e.g., "Standard Tuning", "Drop D")
- **strings** (repeater): Array of string configurations
  - **string_number** (number): String position (1-6)
  - **note** (text): Note name (e.g., "E", "A", "D")
  - **frequency** (number): Target frequency in Hz
  - **octave** (number): Octave number
- **description** (textarea): Optional description of the tuning
- **difficulty** (select): Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **is_default** (switch): Mark as default tuning
